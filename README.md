# ruby_04-03_master-mind

A Ruby exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) based on the [classic (aka very old) board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). Object-oriented project with a board, pieces, selectable players, and an AI/algorithm for evaluating the possible moves left to guess at.
